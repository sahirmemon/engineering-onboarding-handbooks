# Onboarding Handbook

### Welcome & Introductions

We would like to welcome you to Pager Inc. The purpose of this onboarding handbook is to provide you with comprehensive guidance and direction during your onboarding, familiarize you with Pager Inc. systems, designate a coding buddy, and generally set you up for success.

### Team Structure at Pager

Pager engineering consists of five squads, most of them specializing in a different Pager product:

| Squad Name | Slack Channel | Email distro | JIRA Board |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Management Enterprise (ME) | #squad-management-enterprise | squad-management-enterprise@pager.com | [ME backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=64&projectKey=ME&view=planning.nodetail&issueLimit=100) |
| Consumer Squad (CS) | #squad-consumer | squad-consumer@pager.com | [CS backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=49&view=planning.nodetail&issueLimit=100) |    
| Users Enterprise (UE) | #squad-users-enterprise | squad-users-enterprise@pager.com | [UE backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=79&projectKey=UE&view=planning&selectedIssue=UE-912&epics=visible&issueLimit=100) |    
| Professional Services Squad (PSS) | #squad-professional-services | squad-professional-services@pager.com | [PSS backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=87&projectKey=PSS&view=planning&selectedIssue=PSS-18&issueLimit=100) |
| Platform Squad (PS) | #squad-platform | squad-platform@pager.com | [PS backlog](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=59&projectKey=PS&view=planning.nodetail&selectedIssue=PS-674&issueLimit=100) |

Except Platform Squad, each squad contains engineers from frontend (web and/or mobile), backend, machine learning/data as well as QA. Here is the [org chart](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14hRZNhhM9m_t88lR9jOoqDkvewiQDf3Rc0wW7n3iyDI/edit) for our squads. 
If interested, see [this medium article](https://medium.com/scaled-agile-framework/exploring-key-elements-of-spotifys-agile-scaling-model-471d2a23d7ea) for more information about squad structure. 

During your first week, you will be meeting your team members, as well as team leads, who will provide you with an important overview of their respective areas of expertise. 

**Your Direct Manager:** [Insert name]\
Your manager will meet with you on your first day to welcome you to Pager, get to know you, understand your personal and professional goals. The purpose of the first meeting is to introduce you to this document, and set initial expectations. You will have a second meeting with your manager at the end of your first week, to check-in on your onboarding progress and introduce you to your 30-60-90 day plan.

**Coding Buddy:** [Insert name]\
One of the key figures during your first few weeks is your coding buddy. Your coding buddy will be your initial source of information about various systems, tools and practices at Pager. In addition to being your go-to person for code related questions, you can expect your coding buddy to help you pick up your first coding assignments. This will help you dive into coding as quickly as possible, without overwhelming you.

### Command Center Environment URLs
There are various levels of environments used in Pager for development, testing, and production. The environment levels, from lowest to highest, are qa, staging, and production. There are also three different client versions of the site dependent on which client the site is being used for, each having their own abbreviation. Sura is abbreviated as "sra", Horizon as "hrz", and a multi-tenant client abbreviated "pgr". Pgr is a generic version used by a variety of clients. The url structure for each of these environments are as follows: 

**LL (Lower Level Environments) - QA and Staging**
{{client abbreviation}}-{{environment level}}-command-center.pagerinc.com
- e.g: 
    - https://pgr-stage-command-center.pagerinc.com/
    - https://hrz-stage-command-center.pagerinc.com/

**Production Level URLs**
- https://sra-command-center.pager.com/
- https://command-center.pager.com/
- https://hrz-command-center.pager.com/
- https://pgr-rr-command-center.pager.com/

**Confluence**
- [This gathers information](https://pagerinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRODUCT/pages/605421622/Hands+on+Pager+s+product) on how to install and use several parts of Pager’s product.

### Front End Development and QA Workflow
For any Frontend user story being worked on, the engineer needs to make a local branch off of the `develop` branch. Branch names related to JIRA tickets should use the following naming convention: {{Story number}}_{{short description}} (i.e. UE-932_refactor). All changes should be made on a local branch and then committed to their remote branch on github. Then, a Pull Request should be made, which will trigger the CI/CD checks to run. PR links should be posted in the `#web-chapter` slack channel for review. Once the appropriate amount of approvals is given, and the CI/CD checks pass, QA should be notified that the story pertaining to the PR is ready to test. Requests for testing should be posted in the #squad-qa slack channel. Once the story passes QA, the PR is ready to be merged into the `develop` branch.

### System requirements to start the development server

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 10.0.0 && <= 12.16.2). It’s recommend the use of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

2. Inside your code editor:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
